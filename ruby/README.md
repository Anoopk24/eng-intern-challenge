# Ruby Instructions

## Installation

Make sure you have Ruby installed on your machine. If not, you can download it [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).

## Running the code

To run the code, open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the file.

```
cd ruby
```

Then run the following command:

```
ruby translator.rb <input>
```

Replace `<input>` with the string you want to translate. For example:

```
ruby translator.rb hello
```

This will output the translation of the input string

```
O.OO..O..O..O.O.O.O.O.O.O..OO.
```
