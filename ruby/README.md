# Ruby Instructions


<b>PLEASE NOTE:</b>
<br>
As discussed in the issues on the Github repo, the test cases are incorrect in this folder. Ive choose not to touch the test file as its stated NOT to touch them.

I've choose to stick with the Braille system that was defined in the image of the instructions. The tests cases will fail since they are expecting the following

```ruby
BRAILLE_TO_NUMBERS = {
    "0" => "O.....",
    "1" => "O.O...",
    "2" => "OO....",
    "3" => "OO.O..",
    "4" => "O..O..",
    "5" => "OOO...",
    "6" => "OOOO..",
    "7" => "O.OO..",
    "8" => ".OO...",
    "9" => ".OOO..",
}
```
