# Python Instructions

# Future Improvements:
- Break project down into seperate modules/classes and add testing for each component ie Logger, Translator, Languages etc
- Create a script to take csvs or images like braille.jpg of langauge symbols to braille mappings and convert them into dictionaries to simplify support of new languages/chars
