Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this! 

I learned a lot about myself and developed new skills through implementing this code for this challenge!

Although it is not required, I wanted to challenge myself and add the special characters as well as the decimal follows character. 

For example, 3.14 would be (number-follows-character, 3, decimal-follows-character, 1 4)

For any message that is not an eligible Braille text (ex. character isn't defined in Braille dictionary (referenced from the image provided), text is not a multiple of 6 characters), it will return a corresponding error.
