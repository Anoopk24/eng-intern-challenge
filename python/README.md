# Python Instructions

Note that the Python version used is 3.8

# Pseudo Code
-> Create a dictionary to map all the keys to their respective values
-> Check if string is braille
-> If braille translate to english
  -> Break up into cells of 6. Translate each cell to english. Then join them together after
-> else translate to braille
  -> This Im hoping is more straight forward


#Assumptions
Im under the assumption that the input will always be valid and that the user will only provide values that are either in English or in braille. 
That means that there will be no braille cells that do not exist in the dictionary. Such as :w
Furthermore, I am assuming that the user will only use characters that were specified in the requirements.
