# Python Instructions

Note that the Python version used is 3.8


Instruction regarding python test file:


Please use `python3 -m unittest translator_test.py` to run the test as unittest (https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) framework accept only names with underscore( _ ) not with period ( . ) hence I made a change in file name. Rest all is same. I have sent an email regarding the same issue at internprogram@shopify.com.


## Run
Run `python3 translator.py <your_string>` 
Test `python3 -m unittest translator_test.py`
