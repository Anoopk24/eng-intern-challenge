# Assumptions

1- The program assumes the input text will consist solely of English alphabets, numeric digits, and basic punctuation symbols (e.g., periods, commas, question marks, etc.).

2- Braille is represented using six-character sequences, where raised dots are indicated by the uppercase letter 'O', and unraised dots by a period ('.').

3- The program does not support non-alphabetic characters beyond a predefined set of basic punctuation symbols, spaces, and digits.
