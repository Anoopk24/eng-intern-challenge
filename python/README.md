# Python Instructions
The following code is built with Python 3.10.6 64-bit on Windows 11

Running this program, I assume that you will be running it similar to how the translator.test.py runs its test (i.e. python translator.py "some word" in the terminal). 

NOTE: On the 7th instruction it says our application must output only the Braille/English string. I have done that in addition to adding some error checking. So if there is any unit testing that expects a miss-input to show the full stacktrace, my program will not do that.
