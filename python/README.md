# Python Instructions

The Python version used for this implementation is 3.8. Please ensure that your environment is set up with this version to run the translator correctly.

# Additional Notes

This translator meets the requirements specified in the instructions and nothing more. Features such as detecting and translating additional symbols or punctuation were not implemented, but they can be easily added if needed.

# Additional Test Cases

The following test cases were used to validate the functionality of the translator beyond the provided examples:

1. **All Capital Letters:**
   - Input: `"HELLO"`
   - Expected Output: Braille representation of all capitalized letters in English.

2. **Mixed Case and Numbers:**
   - Input: `"Hello World 42"`
   - Expected Output: Correct Braille translation for a string with mixed case letters, spaces, and numbers.

3. **Continuous Digits:**
   - Input: `"123456"`
   - Expected Output: Braille translation for a sequence of numbers.

4. **Braille to English with Capitals and Lowercase:**
   - Input: Braille representation for `"Abc"`
   - Expected Output: `"Abc"` (with the correct capitalization).

5. **Braille Input Consisting of Spaces:**
   - Input: Braille representation for spaces.
   - Expected Output: Equivalent English spaces.

6. **Single Lowercase Character:**
   - Input: Braille representation for a single letter, e.g., `"a"`.
   - Expected Output: `"a"`.

7. **Single Capital Letter:**
   - Input: Braille representation for a capital letter, e.g., `"A"`.
   - Expected Output: `"A"`.

8. **Long String with Mixed Case and Numbers:**
   - Input: Braille representation for `"Abc 123 xYz"`.
   - Expected Output: Correct English translation preserving the structure and case.

9. **Empty Braille Input:**
   - Input: An empty Braille string.
   - Expected Output: An empty English string.

10. **Consecutive Capital Letters:**
    - Input: Braille representation for consecutive capital letters, e.g., `"ABC"`.
    - Expected Output: Correct capitalization in the English translation.

11. **Long Sequence of Numbers:**
    - Input: Braille representation for a long sequence of numbers, e.g., `"123456"`.
    - Expected Output: Correct numerical translation.

12. **Single Number:**
    - Input: Braille representation for a single number, e.g., `"1"`.
    - Expected Output: Correct English translation of the number.

These test cases were used to ensure that the translator performs as expected for a variety of input scenarios. Although they are not included in the test file for this challenge, they were verified during the development process.
