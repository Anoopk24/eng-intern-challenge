# Python Instructions

Note that the Python version used is 3.8

In this challenge I used Java to think about the solution because I didn't  have experience with Python or the others language provided for this task.
I have done a quickly learn about Python, so I can convert code from Java to Python.
This code may not an optimize way of writing code but if I had a chane, I'm willing and eager to learn whatever your company need. 
Thank you so much for considering me.
