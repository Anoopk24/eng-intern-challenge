# Braille Translator

Hello Shopifolk! ðŸ‘‹

This project is a command-line Braille translator that can convert English text to Braille and vice versa. The input string is automatically detected and translated accordingly.


## Approach ðŸ’¡
The translator uses simple mappings to convert between English and Braille. It handles special cases like capitalization and numbers. Unknown characters are translated as spaces to ensure robustness.

## How to Run ðŸš€

To run the Braille translator, use the following command:

```bash
python3 translator.py <input_string>
```

## Personal Note ðŸ’¬

I just wanted to say that this challenge was a much-needed break from the extremely bleak and boring application processes that I have been going through to find my next internship! It was great to get a change of pace and work on something that has real-world application and is meaningful. I'm sure this challenge is just a taste of the great work to come at Shopify, and I look forward to more opportunities like this!
