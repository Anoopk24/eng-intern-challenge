My thought process is to create a dictionary 
that maps each letter to its corresponding Braille pattern.
I wanted to see if I could do this programmatically without hardcoding the patterns,
because I researched and found that the Braille alphabet are repeating patterns. i.e 
A-J only use a combination of the first 4 dots in the 3x2 matrix.
K-T repeat the pattern of A-J but with an added dot in the bottom left corner.
U-Z repeat the pattern of A-J but with the last row filled out.
W is unique and has a different pattern altogether.

In the end, I aimed for readability and simplicity of the code.
