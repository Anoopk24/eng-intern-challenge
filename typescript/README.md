# TypeScript Instructions
- I used `ts-node translator.ts` to execute my typescript file

**Limitations**
- I was unable to account for `>` characters because both `o` and `>` use the same braille symbol and most braille translators typical differentiate the letters based on the context of the sentence. Therefore, I was unable to include that character in my translator program.
