A terminal / command-line application that can translate Braille to English and vice versa.

The string to translate will be passed into the application as an argument at runtime. The application is smart enough to determine if the string given to it is either Braille or English and automatically convert it to the appropriate opposite.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

```
npm install
```

### Usage

Run the following command to run the application, make sure to pass in command line arguments

```
npm run dev [a phrase of Braille or English]

// Examples
